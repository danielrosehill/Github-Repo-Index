## About My Github Index

This repository index is a mostly manual effort that I get around to updating about once every few months *(which is an improvement on the prior latency of once every few years!)*

I am a fervent and lifelong believer in the value of open sourcing information. If I think there's even a remote chance that somebody might be benefitted or interested by something I'm working on, I will tend towards sharing it. 

Hence my Github profile is a meandering labyrinth of topics. It reflects some very longstanding tech interests of mine: Linux, backups. Some things that I once actively worked on but which are now mostly in maintenance mode. And other topics which I'm exploring now but may not do so in the future. 

Some repos might seem out of place but are of much personal significance: such as the Israel preparedness resources which were very hastily put together and shared during escalations in the security climate. 

Feel free to drop me an email if anything interests you or you'd like to collaborate!
