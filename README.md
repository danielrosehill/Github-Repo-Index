# Daniel Rosehill Github Index

![alt text](images/banner.webp)

*Note: I update this repo index every few months. My 'modus operandi' on Github is something like this: I create a lot of 'first entry' repos. Over time, I work on consolidating and rationalising what I can. I have tech interests that are very longstanding (Linux, backups) as well as those that are more recent (data science, LLMs).*
